# SCRUMPTON Hotel Reservation System

A final group project for CPSC 362, Software Engineering Foundations class @CSUF, Summer 24.<br> 
<br>The SCRUMPTON Hotel Reservation System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the reservation process for guests and provide management tools for hotel staff. It allows users to view and book rooms, while giving managers the ability to oversee and modify reservations.



## Software Description

<b> Front-End: </b> <br>
Reservation System consists of multiple web pages. Different web pages allows Scrumpton Hotel guests to view hotel amenities, sign-up, log-in, view and create reservations. Scrumpton Hotel managers are able to use the same log-in page to gain access to an overview of all guest reservations and the ability  to cancel a guest’s reservation. A combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used to create an easy to use UI.

<b> Back-End: </b> <br>
We used Python for the back end of our Reservation System web pages. We have a class that stores and edits our Hotel Room data, a class that stores and edits Guest data and a class that helps calculate the cost of a guest’s reservation.

<br><b>P.S.</b> The name of the hotel was inspired by the term 'Scrum', an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.
