# SCRUMPTON Hotel Reservation System

## Software Description

<b> Front-End: </b> <br>
Our Reservation System will consist of multiple web pages. Different web pages will allow Scrumpton Hotel guests to view hotel amenities, sign-up, log-in, view and create reservations. Scrumpton Hotel managers will be able to use the same log-in page to gain access to an overview of all guest reservations and the ability  to cancel a guest’s reservation. A combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used to create an easy to use UI.

<b> Back-End: </b> <br>
We used Python for the back end of our Reservation System web pages. We have a class that stores and edits our Hotel Room data, a class that stores and edits Guest data and a class that helps calculate the cost of a guest’s reservation.
