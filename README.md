# SCRUMPTON Hotel Reservation System

SCRUMPTON Hotel is a final team project for CPSC 362, Software Engineering Foundations class @CSUF, Summer 24.<br> 




## Software Description

<b> Front-End: </b> <br>
Reservation System consists of multiple web pages. Different web pages allows Scrumpton Hotel guests to view hotel amenities, sign-up, log-in, view and create reservations. Scrumpton Hotel managers are able to use the same log-in page to gain access to an overview of all guest reservations and the ability  to cancel a guest’s reservation. A combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used to create an easy to use UI.

<b> Back-End: </b> <br>
We used Python for the back end of our Reservation System web pages. We have a class that stores and edits our Hotel Room data, a class that stores and edits Guest data and a class that helps calculate the cost of a guest’s reservation.







## Conclusions and Future Work 

 #### Lessons Learned
* Not to overestimate how many functions can be included in a time-box. We had to cut out more functions from our program than anticipated.
* The importance of communicating with team members in order to complete tasks efficiently and accurately. 
* How to connect front and back ends of programs. Using different programming languages in one project was a great learning experience.
* New programming languages. Some of our members had the opportunity to learn one or more programming languages while we put together this project.

#### Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Deviations

* Guests cannot edit or cancel their reservation through our software
* Managers are still able to delete a guest’s reservation on request
* Guests cannot check in or out through our software
* Guests cannot include add-ons with their reservations.
* Guests do not receive a thank you email on completion of their reservation
* Managers cannot add on fees to guest statements

#### Future Work

* Expand our Reservation System to multiple Hotels. Currently only set up for a singular location.
* Switching Room and Guest data to an online dataset
* Allow Managers to post and edit different Hotel activities
* Have an outside tester for quality assurance
* Add in SRS deviations



<b>P.S.</b> The name of the hotel was inspired by the term 'Scrum', an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.
